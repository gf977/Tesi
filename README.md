Modeling peer-pressure: a data-driven estimate of open-mindedness from high-order online political discussions

### Abstract

One of the main research areas of Social Network Analysis is Opinion Dynamics, which studies how individuals form, share and update their opinions in social networks.
The necessity of going beyond pairwise interactions modeled by ordinary graphs has led to the development
of higher-order structures that allow modeling non-linear multiagent interactions. 
This change requires also the adaptation of Opinion Dynamic models to the new configuration, which is one of the goals of this thesis. 
In this work, we focus on confidence bound models, where each individual interacts with their peers only if the difference between their opinions is smaller than a given threshold, which can be interpreted as their level of open-mindedness. 
This study adopts a data-driven approach to estimate the user’s open-mindedness following a Deffuant-like procedure applied on real networks which are defined from online political discussions in the U.S. 
In fact, the possibility to collect new information regarding users’ interactions due to the increment of online social network platforms usage, allows to provide empirical validation of the models. 
The goal is not only to estimate the users’ open-mindedness in real networks, but also to understand if and how the two different underlying structures influence the results of the procedures.
